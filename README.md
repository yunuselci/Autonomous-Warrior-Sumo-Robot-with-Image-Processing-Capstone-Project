# Autonomous-Warrior-Sumo-Robot-with-Image-Processing-Capstone-Project

The goal of the project is to build an autonomous warrior sumo robot with image processing to win the competition against the opponents in a dohyo.

There will be opponents (color and shape) and allies (with different shapes and same color) in sumo dohyo. The warrior sumo robot will detect the opponents and directly attack them to win. The warrior sumo robot must keep the allies safe. All the opponents should be sent out of dohyo for a win.

Three computer engineering students and three mechatronics engineering students worked on the project.
